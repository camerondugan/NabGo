# Current progress

## EdgeDB

- Start of EdgeDB project named NabGo-backend

## Started Go backend in Go (for connection to EdgeDB)

- Connected to local EdgeDB instance (could change this later to be another computer)
- To help development: see [this link](https://docs.edgedb.com/libraries/go)
- Goal: to have Golang back-end run on my server accessible to the Go front-end
